        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Dom. I am a professional chef turned web devloper. I began my
          career change from the kitchen to working in tech during 2023, where I
          began Codecademy's Full stack web developement course and completed a
          12 week intensive Full stack boot camp with Tech Educators. During
          this time I have been increasing my knowledge and skills with HTML,
          CSS and Javascript.
          <br />
          As I continue learning through Codecademy and my bootcamp with Tech
          Educators, I am enjoying and embracing the new challenges and lessons
          in web development.

        <p>
          Many of these projects are exercises in focusing on functionality with
          many of them having incomplete styling.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Project 1</h4>
        <p>
          This City explorer project was my first outing into learning about and
          using API's. Created during a bootcamp with Tech Educators, this page
          was created to search for any city in the world and provide a map
          image as well as coordinates. On top of this I added a basic zoom
          funtion.
        </p>

          >City Explorer</a
        >
        <br />
        <h4>Project 2</h4>
        <p>
          Another little about me page created as one of my first ventures into
          using Javascript. This page has some basic information about myself
          and previous work experience and a little quiz.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h4>Project 3</h4>
        <p>
          This project was created as part of a small team towards the end of
          the Tech Educators bootcamp, built with React. This project was tough
          due to a rather short window to come up with the idea, plan and then
          execute. The probelm domain was to create an app aimed at new parents
          loking to track details of their new borns sleep, feeding and nappy
          changes with the aim to look back at a chart of all the input data and
          view and patterns. While I am happy with what my team and I managed to
          create in a few days, I feel we lost track of the scope of the project
          a few times. Thus leading us to failing to finish a lot of the
          functionality and styling.
